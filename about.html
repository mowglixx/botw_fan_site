          <h2>About this site</h2>
          <p>
            This website was developed as a proof of knowledge after 2 weeks of
            CodeNation training.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site is a demo of what can be achieved without JavaScript and
            all styles including aesthetic icons have been created using custom
            fonts and CSS3 Features, one such feature is the
            <code>:after</code> pseudo element
          </p>
          <h2>Triforce Icons in nav</h2>
          <pre>
.triforce {
  font-family: "Triforce";
  color: var(--triforce-gold);
  }
.triforce:after {
  content: "*";
  }
</pre
          >
          <p>
            This approach made the site more accessible to screen readers by not
            having unnecessary characters on the screen similar to the way
            FontAwesome provides their fonts, each .icon has a defining style
            with the icon color and font and the :after defines the symbol being
            used to conjure up the icon from the selected font without adding
            characters to the HTML.

          <h3>My Time at Code nation</h3>
          <p>
            I have loved being part of a code project after begining to lose
            hope of becoming a professional developer, code nation have made me
            realise that it can be a reality and that anyone can code.
          </p>
          <p>This website was part of a coding assignment during CodeNation</p>
          <p>
            It has been a pleasure to work with James, Ste and of course, Tim
            during this time.
